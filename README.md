# GraGLeS2D

Grain Growth Level Set 2dim (GraGLeS2D) is a software kit to simulate the grain growth phenoma as it occurs in polycrystalline materials. The software is designed to account for anisotropic grain boundaries and finite, in particular, low triple junction mobilities. Then algorithm utilizes an OpenMP parallelization and is optimized (and ongoing work) for ccNUMA archictecture.
