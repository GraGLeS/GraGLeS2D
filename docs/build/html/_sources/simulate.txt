How to simulate input
=====================

It is necessary to have collected results in the form of a sequence of microstructure snapshots. In its first version data from the 2D anisotropic grain growth simulation packages are utilized.
One approach is to utilize GraGLeS2D. It is a OpenMP-parallelized computer program for simulating the evolution of anisotropic grain growth phenomena in polycrystal in 2D that makes use of the level-set method. It is free to download from::
