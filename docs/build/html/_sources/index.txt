.. Documentation to the TopologyTracer
.. ===================================

TopologyTracer is a postprocessing tool for the identification of structural changes in the topology, the properties of grains, and their neighbors from grain growth simulation data conducted in synthetic polycrystals. 
The source is developed by Markus Kuhbach at the Institute of Physical Metallurgy and Metal Physics.

1. Getting started
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The compilation of TopologyTracer utilizes standard Linux tools.

2. Creating input

3. Tracing grains
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default it is assumed that the executable is placed in the same folder as the raw data. Then, **tracing**, i.e. the process of postprocessing time-resolved data with TopologyTracer is invoked with the following command line call::

   mpiexec -n <proc> topologytracer <1> <2> <3> <4> <5> <6>
   
In its current version the following six input arguments are necessary:
 | <proc> **HowManyProcesses**
 | <1> **JobID** a positive integer to distinguish the simulation output from other data
 | <2> **N0** the number of grains found in total in the earliest time step. It is assumed that upon grain growth the number of grains shrinks.
 | <3> **<First>** ID of the first snapshot that should be considered, positive integer
 | <4> **<Offset>** how many simulation steps are the snapshots apart, positive integer
 | <5> **<Last>** ID of the last snapshot that should be considered, positive integer
 | <6> **<MemoryPerProcess>** how much physical memory is guaranteed to be safely written to per process, in MB



During reading GraGLeS2D input data the TopologyTracer automatically determines the file size to plan how many snapshots that are consecutive in simulation time can be loaded into a single process. This improves data locality.
However this requires a smart choice of the <6>. Imaging for instance 1000 snapshots of 50 GB in total now if 10 nodes are commissioned each given <6> as 10 GB, the first node is going to collect as many snapshot data until it filled its 10 GB, consequently only probably 5 nodes become work, while the others idle.
On the other hand the number of process should not exceed the number of physical devices onto which the snapshot are stored as this would quickly congest physically the media servers.

4. Visualizing results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In its current state the TopologyTracer does not contain a GUI yet. Instead, plain MPI I/O raw files are being generated and postprocessed with the MATLAB scripts available in the *scripts* folder.
